                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>On March 25th, 2011 at the Memorial Chapel at Wesleyan 
                University I gave the first and only performance of my 
                senior project "An Evening with Paul Linton." The pieces for this 
                performance offered a 'world tour' of some late twentieth century 
                works for the organ, with the particular intention to move forward 
                with these pieces and the concepts underlying them towards a model 
                in which the computer has an active part, using both the 
                computerized systems of the organ and external computers. The 
                concert was stuctured as a steady progression from least 
                involvement by the computer to the greatest involvement with Knee 
                Play 1 and Knee Play 5 acting as a comfortable easing in and out 
                for the audience. The pipe organ is a most flexible and adaptable 
                keyboard instrument that can interact fluently with the computer.
                I encourage composers and performers to continue this exploration 
                of the interaction between a performer and the computer and the 
                role of the computer in performance. I also hope that the concepts 
                put forward in the performance challenge audiences' ideas of the 
                performer and the computer. A special thank you to all of my 
                assistants and most importantly to my tutor Ron Ebrecht!</p>

                </div>
                <p>The opening piece for the concert was one of my favorites: 
                Philip Glass' Knee Play 1 from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_on_the_beach">
                Einstein on the Beach</a>. I also included the prologue which 
                involves playing an A to a G to a C in ratios of 2:3:4 starting 
                from when the house opens until the concert actually begins (the 
                video below only catches the very end of the prologue). The voices 
                were generated using the <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">
                Festival Speech Synthesis System</a>, including the counting and singing voices
                using Festival's singing mode which were generated into audio 
                files. I intervened in the spoken parts to create a reasonable 
                pacing but the singing parts allowed for computer 'interpretation,' 
                particularly by rushing each rest. I like the term interpretation 
                here, since everything, including errors, is a part of the 
                performance and if a human can create errors that are part of the 
                performance, so can a computer. Jason Jia assisted with page 
                turning.</p>

                <p>With Alvin Lucier's Hands, we begin our examination of the 
                roles of the computer. The easiest place to start is to not have 
                a computer involved at all. Hands is a piece for an organist and 
                assistants where the organist plays two or more adjacent semitones 
                while the assistants place their hands in front of the mouths of 
                the pipes to change the pitches to be closer together. In a 
                musical world dominated by speakers, in which many organs are 
                actually synthesizers, this piece develops a subtle but powerful 
                awareness in the audience that the pipe organ is a wind instrument.
                My assistants were Lana Lana, Aaron Veerasuntharam, Rain Xie and 
                Yvonne Lin.</p>

                <h2>Some of the Harmony of Maine</h2>
                <div class="video-box">
                    <iframe width="640" height="360" 
                            src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VXR9t4dOcgA"

                </div>
                <p>John Cage's Some of the Harmony of Maine provides an example of 
                the computer as an extremely simple assistant. Of the thirteen 
                original tunes by Cage I performed four for the concert: 
                Invitation, Harmony, the Lilly, and Alpha in that order. Whereas 
                normally I would have several assistants changing the pipes 
                manually, I instead had one assistant, Nat Leich, tell the 
                computer in the organ when to change to a different set of stops.
                As a result, I have the computer acting as my assistant and the 
                results were subtle. Human assistants can change a limited number 
                of stops at a time, where as the computer could change them all at 
                once. On the other hand the computer had a slight delay in 
                changing, causing the changes to be very audible and slightly 
                behind the changes in notes at times. This piece is not meant to 
                determine which is better, as that is all a question of what the 
                asker is looking for, but merely to examine the differences.</p>

                <p>This piece, by Ronald Perera, shows the performer and computer 
                acting equally. The computer plays a pre-defined track which 
                complements and contrasts the organ part, however both parts are 
                equal. Unfortunately, the recording below does not really capture 
                the computer's part except at certain points. In addition, one of 
                the speakers began creating a large amount of static for unknown 
                reasons, however this merely becomes part of the performance.</p>

                <h2>Knee Play 5</h2>

                <p>Here we return to Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach and my 
                favorite piece from the opera, Knee Play 5. Again I used Festival
                to generate the spoken and choral voices while I doubled and 
                played the organ part. It is very unfortunate that once again the 
                final spoken part cannot be clearly heard as it is beautiful 
                poetry and an important part of the piece. This piece allows the 
                computer to take the lead with spoken and vocal parts, central to 
                the pice, while the organist takes a supporting role. It is the 
                reversal of the common trend of having a computer create the 
                backing while the performer takes the lead.</p>

            <h1>Senior Project</h1>
            <p>On March 25th, 2011 at the Memorial Chapel at Wesleyan 
            University I gave the first and only performance of my 
            senior project "An Evening with Paul Linton." The pieces for this 
            performance offered a 'world tour' of some late twentieth century 
            works for the organ, with the particular intention to move forward 
            with these pieces and the concepts underlying them towards a model 
            in which the computer has an active part, using both the 
            computerized systems of the organ and external computers. The 
            concert was stuctured as a steady progression from least 
            involvement by the computer to the greatest involvement with Knee 
            Play 1 and Knee Play 5 acting as a comfortable easing in and out 
            for the audience. The pipe organ is a most flexible and adaptable 
            keyboard instrument that can interact fluently with the computer.
            I encourage composers and performers to continue this exploration 
            of the interaction between a performer and the computer and the 
            role of the computer in performance. I also hope that the concepts 
            put forward in the performance challenge audiences' ideas of the 
            performer and the computer. A special thank you to all of my 
            assistants and most importantly to my tutor Ron Ebrecht!</p>

            <h2>Knee Play 1</h2>
            <p>The opening piece for the concert was one of my favorites: 
            Philip Glass' Knee Play 1 from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_on_the_beach">
            Einstein on the Beach</a>. I also included the prologue which 
            involves playing an A to a G to a C in ratios of 2:3:4 starting 
            from when the house opens until the concert actually begins (the 
            video below only catches the very end of the prologue). The voices 
            were generated using the <a href"http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">
            Festival Speech Synthesis System</a>, including the counting and singing voices
            using Festival's singing mode which were generated into audio 
            files. I intervened in the spoken parts to create a reasonable 
            pacing but the singing parts allowed for computer 'interpretation,' 
            particularly by rushing each rest. I like the term interpretation 
            here, since everything, including errors, is a part of the 
            performance and if a human can create errors that are part of the 
            performance, so can a computer. Jason Jia assisted with page 
            turning.</p>

            <h2>Hands</h2>
            <p>With Alvin Lucier's Hands, we begin our examination of the 
            roles of the computer. The easiest place to start is to not have 
            a computer involved at all. Hands is a piece for an organist and 
            assistants where the organist plays two or more adjacent semitones 
            while the assistants place their hands in front of the mouths of 
            the pipes to change the pitches to be closer together. In a 
            musical world dominated by speakers, in which many organs are 
            actually synthesizers, this piece develops a subtle but powerful 
            awareness in the audience that the pipe organ is a wind instrument.
            My assistants were Lana Lana, Aaron Veerasuntharam, Rain Xie and 
            Yvonne Lin.</p>

            <h2>Some of the Harmony of Maine</h2>
            <p>John Cage's Some of the Harmony of Maine provides an example of 
            the computer as an extremely simple assistant. Of the thirteen 
            original tunes by Cage I performed four for the concert: 
            Invitation, Harmony, the Lilly, and Alpha in that order. Whereas 
            normally I would have several assistants changing the pipes 
            manually, I instead had one assistant, Nat Leich, tell the 
            computer in the organ when to change to a different set of stops.
            As a result, I have the computer acting as my assistant and the 
            results were subtle. Human assistants can change a limited number 
            of stops at a time, where as the computer could change them all at 
            once. On the other hand the computer had a slight delay in 
            changing, causing the changes to be very audible and slightly 
            behind the changes in notes at times. This piece is not meant to 
            determine which is better, as that is all a question of what the 
            asker is looking for, but merely to examine the differences.</p>

            <h2>Reverberations</h2>
            <p>This piece, by Ronald Perera, shows the performer and computer 
            acting equally. The computer plays a pre-defined track which 
            complements and contrasts the organ part, however both parts are 
            equal. Unfortunately, the recording below does not really capture 
            the computer's part except at certain points. In addition, one of 
            the speakers began creating a large amount of static for unknown 
            reasons, however this merely becomes part of the performance.</p>

            <h2>Knee Play 5</h2>
            <p>Here we return to Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach and my 
            favorite piece from the opera, Knee Play 5. Again I used Festival
            to generate the spoken and choral voices while I doubled and 
            played the organ part. It is very unfortunate that once again the 
            final spoken part cannot be clearly heard as it is beautiful 
            poetry and an important part of the piece. This piece allows the 
            computer to take the lead with spoken and vocal parts, central to 
            the pice, while the organist takes a supporting role. It is the 
            reversal of the common trend of having a computer create the 
            backing while the performer takes the lead.</p>
